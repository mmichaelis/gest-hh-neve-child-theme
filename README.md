# gest-hh-neve-child-theme

WordPress theme for [gest-hamburg.de](https://gest-hamburg.de) based on
[Neve](https://themeisle.com/themes/neve/)
([Codeinwp/neve](https://github.com/Codeinwp/neve)).

## Release

### Release Types

This repository uses _semantic versioning_, thus, quoting from [semver.org](https://semver.org):

> Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:
>
> 1. `MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes,
> 2. `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
> 3. `PATCH` version when you make backward compatible bug fixes.
>
> Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as
> extensions to the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format.

For a pre-release we use the synonym "snapshot". Such a snapshot release
has a label `rc`, so that the _Release Candidate_ for version `1.2.3` would be
`1.2.3-rc.4`, where `4` is the next snapshot increment version.

If in doubt, choose:

* `patch` for typical releases to be used on the website.
* `snapshot` for releases to be used for testing purposes.

### Manually

Assume, you have no tooling, no Linux at hand, there is always a completely
manual way to create a ZIP suitable for uploading it to the WordPress site.

1. Copy the files located in `src/` to a new directory named
   `gest-hh-neve-child`.

2. Add required theme metadata to `style.css` in the header section. Best,
   compare it to previous versions and just increase the version number.
   Here is a sample, that may be used:

   ```css
